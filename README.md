## Picks 
<details>
<summary><strong>Why did I pick these tools?</strong></summary>

- **Bash:** used bash a lot the last years and want to try some parsing with it.
- **CUDA:** new for me, brute forced day 11 last year (blinking intensifies) using CuPy and actually had a lot of fun, want to try and write my own kernel for a problem that is more fitting this time around.
- **Excel:** used to use Excel a lot until 7-8 years ago, will use pure formulas, no macros.
- **Julia:** also new for me, but heard a lot of great things about it.
- **Marimo:** definitely a flex pick, replaced all my EDA notebooks and light UI with Marimo, goal is to use the interactive nature of Marimo for a problem that is suited for it (like day 8 '22).
- **MATLAB:** used this 15 years ago for the last time, liked it then.
- **NetworkX:** went deep into networkx last year and really enjoyed getting back into graph algorithms.
- **OpenVINO:** want to do one edge-inference style solution with an old Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, will probably regret this pick.
- **OR-Tools:** it's often not ideal, but I want to solve using solvers at least once.
- **Rust:** have been learning Rust for the last year and a half, still struggling a bit though.
- **SQL:** SQL can JOIN this year too.
- **WebGPU:** another new one, want to drive the puzzle state from the browser and offload heavy lifting to the GPU.

## Log
| Day | Tool | Rationale/Experience | Rating | Minutes |
|-----|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| [1](day1/)   | Excel | Good problem to tick off excel reused most for part 2 | Easy  | 13/15    |
| [2](day2/) | Bash | Used Termux on android, part 1 was straightforward, got stuck a bit on part 2, mainly because long processing time complicated it  |   Easy    |  19/54    |
| 3   | ?    |           |            |         |
