# Advent of Code 2025

A different tool (software, language or library) for each day.

| Day | Tool         |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | Excel         |
| 2   | Bash          |
| 3   | ?             |
| 4   | ?             |
| 5   | ?             |
| 6   | ?             |

| 8   | ?             |
| 9   | ?             |
| 10  | ?             |
| 11  | ?             |
| 12  | ?             |

## Bingo Card

12 days, 12 options, pick wisely. 

|  |    |    |
|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| ~~Bash~~ | CUDA | ~~Excel~~ |
| Julia | Marimo | MATLAB |
| NetworkX | OpenVINO | OR-Tools |
| Rust | SQL | WebGPU |

## Why did I pick these tools? 

- **Bash:** used bash a lot the last years and want to try some parsing with it.  
- **CUDA:** brute forced day 11 last year (blinking intensifies) using CuPy and actually had a lot of fun, want to try and write my own kernel for a problem that is more fitting this year.  
- **Excel:** used to use Excel a lot until 7-8 years ago, will use pure formulas, no macros. 
- **Julia:** new language for me, but heard a lot of great things about it. 
- **Marimo:** definitely a flex pick, replaced all my EDA notebooks and light UI with Marimo, goal is to use the interactive nature of Marimo for a problem that is suited for it (like day 8 '22). 
- **MATLAB:** used this 15 years ago for the last time, liked it then.  
- **NetworkX:** went deep into networkx last year and really enjoyed getting back into graph algorithms.  
- **OpenVINO:** want to do one edge-inference style solution with an old Intel Neural Compute Stick 2. 
- **OR-Tools:** it's often not ideal, but I want to solve using solvers at least once. 
- **Rust:** have been learning Rust for the last year and a half, still struggling a bit though.  
- **SQL:** SQL can JOIN this year too.  
- **WebGPU:** another new one, want to drive the puzzle state from the browser and offload heavy lifting to the GPU.
